# iris-prediction-with-streamlit
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica
and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict
flowers based on their specific features.

Here I have done this using web app called streamlit.
